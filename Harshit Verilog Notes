What are modules?                                                                                        
Modules are similar to functions 
Syntax:
  module module_name( output output_name );
-    some code 
  endmodule 
If there is no code written in module it will behave as a wire giving zero output 


WIRES
They are unidirectional 
Syntax :
assign output = input;
This means that the output is continuously given the input value 
Sample code:
    module top_module( 
    input a, b, c,
    output w, x, y, z 
);
    assign {w, x, y, z} = {a, b, b, c};
endmodule
(refer : https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Wire4)


NOT GATE
in c++ we use != in verilog we use =~ FOR NOT GATE 
EXAMPLE:
module top_module( input in, output out );
assign out =~ in ;
endmodule


AND GATE 
Verilog has separate bitwise-AND (&) and logical-AND (&&) operators, like C.
Since we're working with a one-bit here, it doesn't matter which we choose.
EXAMPLE : 
module top_module( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    output out );
assign out = a&b;
endmodule


OR GATE 
Verilog has separate bitwise-OR (|) and logical-OR (||) operators, like C.
Since we're working with a one-bit here, it doesn't matter which we choose.
module top_module(
    input a,
    input b,
    output out
);
    assign out = a | b;
endmodule


NOR GATE : 
module top_module( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    output out );
    assign out =~ (a|b); // Notice : That i have used bracket to specify priority
endmodule


XOR GATE :
The bitwise-XOR operator is ^. There is no logical-XOR operator.


DECLARING WIRE FOR COMPLEX CIRCUIT:
SYNTAX: 
wire wire_name;
refer : https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Wire_decl for more explaination


------VECTORS-------
wire [99:0] my_vector;      // Declare a 100-element vector
assign out = my_vector[10]; // Part-select one bit out of the vector

Declaring Vectors
Vectors must be declared:
type [upper:lower] vector_name;
type specifies the datatype of the vector. This is usually wire or reg. 
If you are declaring a input or output port, the type can additionally
include the port type (e.g., input or output) as well. Some examples:

wire [7:0] w;         // 8-bit wire
reg  [4:1] x;         // 4-bit reg
output reg [0:0] y;   // 1-bit reg that is also an output port (this is still a vector)
input wire [3:-2] z;  // 6-bit wire input (negative ranges are allowed)
output [3:0] a;       // 4-bit output wire. Type is 'wire' unless specified otherwise.
wire [0:7] b;         // 8-bit wire where b[0] is the most-significant bit.

EXAMPLE:
module top_module ( 
    input wire [2:0] vec,
    output wire [2:0] outv,
    output wire o2,
    output wire o1,
    output wire o0  ); // Module body starts after module declaration
assign outv=vec;
    assign o0=vec[0];
    assign o1 =vec[1];
    assign o2 =vec[2];
endmodule


IMPLICIT NETS
wire [2:0] a, c;   // Two vectors
assign a = 3'b101;  // a = 101
assign b = a;       // b =   1  implicitly-created wire matlab verilog ne khud 1-bit ka wire bana 
                                diya because tumne declare nai kiya
assign c = b;       // c = 001  <-- bug isiliye kyuki tum chahte the ki c=a aaye but aabhi tumne 
                                    ye thik se declare nai kiya ki b vector hai and 1-bit wire nai
my_module i1 (d,e); // d and e are implicitly one-bit wide if not declared.
                    // This could be a bug if the port was intended to be a vector.

Adding `default_nettype none would make the second line of code an error, 
which makes the bug more visible.


UNPACKED VS. PACKED ARRAYS
reg [7:0] mem [255:0];   // 256 unpacked elements, each of which is a 8-bit packed vector of reg
                            here [7:0] ek packed array hai aur [255:0] unpacked 
                            yaha hum k rahe hai ki hum 256 bit k reg. ko 8 8 bit k packets main
                            divide kar rahe hai (easy way to understand but not sure if it is right)
reg mem2 [28:0];         // 29 unpacked elements, each of which is a 1-bit reg.


ACCESSING VECTOR ELEMENTS : PART - SELECT
The part-select operator can be used to access a portion of a vector:
w[3:0]      // Only the lower 4 bits of w
x[1]        // The lowest bit of x
x[1:1]      // ...also the lowest bit of x    
z[-1:-2]    // Two lowest bits of z
b[3:0]      // Illegal. Vector part-select must match the direction of the declaration.
b[0:3]      // The *upper* 4 bits of b.
assign w[3:0] = b[0:3];    // Assign upper 4 bits of b to lower 4 bits of w. w[3]=b[0], w[2]=b[1], etc.


CONCATENATION OF VECTORS
{3'b111, 3'b000} => 6'b111000
{1'b1, 1'b0, 3'b101} => 5'b10101
{4'ha, 4'd10} => 8'b10101010     // 4'ha and 4'd10 are both 4'b1010 in binary

The concatenation operator can be used on both the left and right sides of assignments.

input [15:0] in;
output [23:0] out;
assign {out[7:0], out[15:8]} = in;         // Swap two bytes. Right side and left side are both 16-bit vectors.
assign out[15:0] = {in[7:0], in[15:8]};    // This is the same thing.
assign out = {in[7:0], in[15:8]};       // This is different. The 16-bit vector on the right is extended to
                                        // match the 24-bit vector on the left, so out[23:16] are zero.
                                        // In the first two examples, out[23:16] are not assigned.

{num{vector}}
This replicates vector by num times. num must be a constant. Both sets of braces are required.

Examples:

{5{1'b1}}           // 5'b11111 (or 5'd31 or 5'h1f)
{2{a,b,c}}          // The same as {a,b,c,a,b,c}
{3'd5, {2{3'd6}}}   // 9'b101_110_110. It's a concatenation of 101 with
                    // the second vector, which is two copies of 3'b110.


MODULE K ANDAR MODULE
Great question.

### üí° What does `mod_a` mean?

In Verilog:

```verilog
mod_a instance1 (a, b, out);
```

* `mod_a` is the **name of another module** ‚Äî a submodule that has been defined **elsewhere**.
* You are creating an **instance** of that module, just like calling a function or creating an object in other languages.
* `instance1` is the **instance name** (you can call it anything ‚Äî like `u1`, `m1`, etc.).
* `(a, b, out)` are the **signals you're connecting** to the module‚Äôs **ports**.

---

### üß± Think of it like this:

If this is defined somewhere:

```verilog
module mod_a (
    input in1,
    input in2,
    output out
);
    // Some logic here...
endmodule
```

Then when you write:

```verilog
mod_a instance1 (a, b, out);
```

You are telling Verilog:

> ‚ÄúTake the module called `mod_a`, create one copy of it called `instance1`, and hook it up to my wires: connect `a` to `in1`, `b` to `in2`, and `out` to `out`.‚Äù

### üì¶ Summary:

| Term          | Meaning                                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mod_a`       | The name of a predefined submodule                          |
| `instance1`   | The instance name (you choose it)                           |
| `(a, b, out)` | External wires connected to submodule ports by **position** |

So, **`mod_a` is just the name of the module you are instantiating** ‚Äî in this problem, it‚Äôs already written for you by HDLBits.

Let me know if you want to see what the full module hierarchy looks like visually.
