REPRESENTING NEGATIVE NUMBERS
MSB is designated to show sign. 1 represents negative, 0 represents positive.
Example: (8 bit binary number)
(1001 0011) = -35
(0111 1111) = 127
Range for 8 bit number - -127 to 127
Two zeros 1000 0000 and 0000 0000 having -0 and 0 is a bit complicated

ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF INTEGERS IN BINARY 
if same sign then add and if different sign then subtract
for subtraction its vice versa of add
