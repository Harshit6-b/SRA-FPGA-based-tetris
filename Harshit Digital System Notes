REPRESENTING NEGATIVE NUMBERS
MSB is designated to show sign. 1 represents negative, 0 represents positive.
Example: (8 bit binary number)
(1001 0011) = -35
(0111 1111) = 127
Range for 8 bit number - -127 to 127
Two zeros 1000 0000 and 0000 0000 having -0 and 0 is a bit complicated

ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF INTEGERS IN BINARY 
if same sign then add and if different sign then subtract
for subtraction its vice versa of add






DUALITY PRINCIPLE
replace 0 with 1 and also replace OR gate with AND gate

🔹 SOP (Sum of Products)
Definition: A Boolean expression written as ORs (sums) of ANDs (products).
Form: A·B + A'·C + B·C'
Each product term (AND) is called a minterm.
It is 1 for the combination of inputs that make the function true (1).

🔹 POS (Product of Sums)
Definition: A Boolean expression written as ANDs (products) of ORs (sums).
Form: (A + B)(A' + C)(B + C')
Each sum term (OR) is called a maxterm.
It is 0 for the combination of inputs that make the function false (0).

🔹 What is a Minterm?
A minterm is a product (AND) of all input variables, where each variable appears once,
either in true or complemented form.
A minterm evaluates to 1 for exactly one combination of input values.
Used in SOP (Sum of Products) form.

🔸 What is a Maxterm?
A maxterm is a sum (OR) of all input variables, where each variable appears once,
in true or complemented form.
A maxterm evaluates to 0 for exactly one combination of inputs.
Used in POS (Product of Sums) form.

🔹 Canonical Forms
Every term contains all variables of the function — either in complemented or uncomplemented form.
There are two main types:

1. Canonical Sum of Products (SOP)
A sum (+) of minterms
Each minterm is an AND (·) of all input variables, either in true or complemented form
The function equals 1 for these minterms
General form:
F(A, B, C) = A'B'C + AB'C' + ABC

2. Canonical Product of Sums (POS)
A product (·) of maxterms
Each maxterm is an OR (+) of all input variables, either in true or complemented form
The function equals 0 for these maxterms
General form:
F(A, B, C) = (A + B + C')(A' + B + C)(A + B' + C)

✅ What is a Multiplexer (MUX)?
A multiplexer is a combinational logic circuit that selects one input from many and 
forwards it to a single output line based on select (control) signals.
✅ General Formula
For a 2ⁿ-to-1 MUX:
Number of inputs = 2ⁿ
Number of select lines = n
Number of outputs = 1

✅Decoders
A decoder is a combinational circuit that converts binary inputs into a one-hot output —
meaning only one output is high (1) at a time, corresponding to the binary input value.
n inputs and 2^n outputs OR 1 input and many outputs
Decoder takes maanlo 3 inputs and gives 8 outputs jaise ki abc,abc',ab'c,ab'c',...... aasa
Decoder with inverted output gives a+b+c,a+b+c',a+b'+c,.... aasa
Decoder with enable main ek aur signal AND hoga jaise ki power line ya koi bus

🔷 Encoder
🔹 What it is:
A combinational circuit that encodes a one-hot input into an n-bit binary output.
🔹 Structure:
Inputs: 2ⁿ
Outputs: n
🔸 Problems:
❌ Multiple inputs high: Output is ambiguous
❌ No inputs high: Output is invalid
✅ Solution: Priority Encoder
Assigns priority to inputs (e.g., D₃ > D₂ > D₁ > D₀)
Adds a Valid output signal to indicate valid input
